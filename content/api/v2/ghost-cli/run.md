This utility command starts your Ghost site in foreground.

Use `ghost run` to start Ghost without using the configured process manager. This runs Ghost directly, similar to `node index.js`. 

All the output from Ghost will be written directly to your terminal, showing up any uncaught errors or other output that might not appear in log files.

This is only useful for debugging purposes. Nothing more to see here ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
