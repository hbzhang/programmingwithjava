Use: `{{#is "page"}}{{/is}}` to detect this context

## Description

Whenever you're viewing a static page, you're in the `page` context. The `page` context is not set on posts, which uses the post context instead.

## Routes

The URL used to render a static page is always `/:slug/`. This cannot be customised, unlike post permalinks.

## Templates

The default template for a page is `post.hbs`.

You can optionally include a `page.hbs` file in your theme which will be used for pages instead.

Additionally, you can provide a custom template for a specific page. If there is a `page-:slug.hbs` file with the `:slug` matching the static page's slug this will be used instead.

For example, if you have an 'About' page with the url `/about/`, adding a template called `page-about.hbs` will cause that template to be used for the about page, instead of page.hbs, or post.hbs.

These templates exist in a hierarchy. Ghost looks for a template which matches the slug (`page-:slug.hbs`) first, then looks for `page.hbs` and finally uses `post.hbs` if neither is available.

## Data

The `page` context provides access to the post object which matches the route. A page is just a special type of post, so the data object is called a post, not a page. As with all contexts, all of the `@blog` global data is also available.

When outputting the page, you can use a block expression (`{{#post}}{{/post}}`) to drop into the post scope and access all of the attributes. All of the data available for a page is the same as the data for a post. See a full list of attributes below:

### Post (page) object attributes

- **id** - the incremental ID of the page
- **title** - the title of your static page
- **excerpt** - a short preview of your page content 
- **content** - the content of the page
- **url** - the web address for the static page 
- **feature_image** - the cover image associated with the page
- **featured** - indicates a featured page. Defaults to `false`
- **page** - `true` if the post is a static page. Defaults to `false`
- **meta_title** - custom meta title for the page 
- **meta_description** - custom meta description for the page 
- **published_at** - date and time when the page was published  
- **updated_at** - date and time when the page was last updated
- **created_at** - date and time when the page was created
-  **author** - full details of the page's author
- **tags** - a list of tags associated with the page

## Helpers

Using the `{{#post}}{{/post}}` block expression is the key trick to having a happy time theming your static page. Once inside of the page, you can use any of these useful helpers (and many more) to output your page's data:

`{{title}}`, `{{content}}`, `{{url}}`, `{{author}}`, `{{date}}`, `{{excerpt}}`, `{{img_url}}`, `{{post_class}}]`, `{{tags}}`.

## Example Code

```handlebars:title=page.hbs
<!-- Everything inside the #post tags pulls data from the static page -->
{{#post}}

<article class="{{post_class}}">
  <header class="page-header">
    <h1 class="page-title">{{title}}</h1>
    <section class="page-meta">
      <time class="page-date" datetime="{{date format='YYYY-MM-DD'}}">
        {{date format="DD MMMM YYYY"}}
      </time>
      {{tags prefix=" on "}}
    </section>
  </header>
  <section class="page-content">
    {{content}}
  </section>
</article>

{{/post}}

```
