The `package.json` file is a set of meta data about a theme.

## Overview

The `package.json` file is a required file and sets some information about your theme. Edit this file and keep it up to date with the relevant information about your publication's theme.

To reference a working example of a `package.json` file, review the [Casper file](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper/blob/master/package.json/), and for further information about specific details of package.json handling, read the [npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json).


## Example


```json:title=package.json
{
    "name": "your-theme-name",
    "description": "A brief explanation of your theme",
    "version": "0.5.0",
    "engines": {
        "ghost-api": "v2"
    },
    "license": "MIT",
    "author": {
        "email": "your@email.here"
    },
    "config": {
        "posts_per_page": 10,
        "image_sizes": {}
    },
}
```

The data in the file must be valid JSON, including double quotes around all property names. Every property except the last one should be separated by a comma.

## Additional properties

Here are some of the most common optional properties that can be used in the `package.json` file:

* `config.posts_per_page` - the default number of posts per page is 5, or you can set a custom amount with this property
* `config.image_sizes` - read the [responsive images](/api/handlebars-themes/responsive-images/) guide for more details
* `engines.ghost-api` - indicate what version of the Ghost Content API your theme is compatible with, defaults to v0.1
* `description` - provide a short description about your theme and what makes it unique
* `license` - a valid licence string, we recommend `MIT` ðŸ˜‰
