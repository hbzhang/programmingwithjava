It will guide you in two sections: \n\n 1. Installing the WordPress plugin and exporting your data\n 2. Using a local install of Ghost to get an up-to-date JSON export suitable for\n    the latest version of Ghost\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUsing the WordPress plugin\nThe Ghost Plugin for WordPress [https://wordpress.org/plugins/ghost/]  allows\nyou to export your self-hosted or local WordPress data in a format that can be\nimported into a Ghost publication.\n\nFind & install the Ghost plugin\nLog into your WordPress Installation and navigate to Plugins > Add Plugins.\n\nSearch for “Ghost” in the search bar and click Install Now  once the plugin has\nbeen located, then click Activate when the plugin has finished installing.\n\nConvert WordPress categories to tags\nAll Categories in WordPress must be converted to tags for Ghost. To convert\ncategories to tags in WordPress, go to Tools > Import  and click “Install Now”\nnext to “Categories and Tags Converter.”\n\nOnce installed, click “Run Importer” to access the conversion tool, and check\nall categories to be converted.\n\nRun the Ghost plugin\nTo create your Ghost export file, go to Tools > Export to Ghost  and click the\n“Download Ghost File.” A JSON file containing your WordPress data will be saved\nto your computer.\n\nRetrieve your WordPress image directory\nThe Ghost plugin does not export images. Images need to be downloaded separately\nfrom the WordPress install, at the default location images are stored (e.g. \nwp-content/  uploads).\n\nUpdate image paths in JSON file\nIn WordPress, images are located at /wp-content/uploads/  by default. In Ghost,\nimages are located at /content/images  by default. To ensure there are no broken\nimages after migrating content to Ghost, update the image paths in your JSON\nexport file, before importing to Ghost.\n\nUsing an HTML or text editor, open the JSON file generated by the Ghost Plugin,\nand perform a find and replace for the following:\n\nFind:  /wp-content/uploads/\nReplace:  /content/images/\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nImporting your content to Ghost\nExports from the Ghost WordPress plugin only work with Ghost v1. In order to\nprepare your content for the latest version\n[https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/releases]  of Ghost, follow these steps:\n\n * Install Ghost v1 locally\n * Import your WordPress export file\n * Upgrade your local install of Ghost to the latest version\n * Export your content again from your updated local version of Ghost\n * Import the final JSON export file to your production instance of Ghost or\n   Ghost(Pro)\n\nBelow is a detailed tutorial of how to do this.\n\nInstall Ghost v1 locally\nEnsure you have the correct pre-requisites to install Ghost locally by referring\nto our local install guide [https://docs.ghost.org/install/local/]. \n\nThis includes a supported version of Node.js, yarn or npm and the Ghost CLI.\nOnce you’ve done this, create a new local install on your machine as follows:\n\n 1. Create an empty directory and give it a suitable name\n 2. Open a terminal window\n 3. cd into the empty directory you just created\n 4. Run the install command ghost install local --v1\n\nWhen the install is finished, go to http://localhost:2368/ghost  and create your\nowner account to access Ghost admin.\n\nImport the WordPress export file\nFrom the admin area of your local install, go to the Labs settings and click the\n“Import” button to import the JSON file you exported from WordPress earlier.\n\nUpgrade your local install\nThe final step to produce a file that can be imported into Ghost(Pro) is to\nupgrade your local Ghost install.To upgrade Ghost, open a terminal window and cd\nto the directory of your local Ghost install and run the upgrade command:\n\nghost update\n\nGhost CLI will handle the rest – once it’s finished updating proceed to the next\nstep.\n\nExport from Ghost\nFrom the Labs section in the admin of your local install, use the “Export”\nbutton to generate another export of your data. This is the last export you’ll\nneed to do! A new JSON file will be saved to your computer which you will then\nbe able to import to a production instance of Ghost running the latest version.\n\nImporting images into Ghost\nGhost can import images within a provided zip file. For a self-hosted install,\nthe images need to be located in a folder called content/images. You can also\nimport your images from the Labs page in Ghost Admin.\n\n> For assistance importing large image directories into Ghost(Pro), contact\nsupport.\nFinal steps\nOnce you’ve followed these steps and imported your content into the latest\nversion of Ghost on production, check that the content has been imported\ncorrectly. You should be able to see your posts in Ghost admin, and visit your\nsite to ensure your content and images have been migrated successfully.\n\nTip 💡\nSome things that you might want to do next include:\n\n * Implement any necessary redirects – here’s a tutorial\n   [https://docs.ghost.org/tutorials/implementing-redirects/]  for working with\n   redirects in Ghost\n * Review custom meta data for your content – discover what you can do with\n   Ghost publishing options [https://docs.ghost.org/faq/publishing-options/]\n * Customise your theme, if you haven’t already – use our theme documentation\n   [https://docs.ghost.org/api/handlebars-themes/]  to find out more","featured":false,"created_at_pretty":"22 April, 2019","published_at_pretty":"22 April, 2019","updated_at_pretty":"14 May, 2019","created_at":"2019-04-22T15:04:02.000+00:00","published_at":"2019-04-22T15:50:47.000+00:00","updated_at":"2019-05-14T11:59:13.000+00:00","tags":[{"name":"Ghost(Pro)","slug":"ghost-pro","visibility":"public"},{"name":"General","slug":"general","visibility":"public"},{"name":"Self-hosting","slug":"self-hosting","visibility":"public"},{"name":"#faq","slug":"hash-faq","visibility":"internal"}],"authors":[{"name":"Kym Ellis","slug":"kym"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c9b9ec28b805000c00450db","slug":"nginx-subdirectory-setup","title":"Nginx Subdirectory Setup","excerpt":"It's possible to setup a reverse proxy using an nginx configuration to establish\na subdirectory on Ghost(Pro). \n\nFor this configuration to work successfully, you must be on a Business plan with\na subdirectory enabled via support@ghost.org.

In addition to a proxy, you must also contact \nsupport@ghost.org  to indicate the subdirectory path to be used with your\npublication.\n\nReverse proxy rules\nFollow these rules to create a valid reverse proxy to Ghost(Pro). You can use\nthe same setup to proxy if you don't need a subdirectory as well. \n\n1. Provide a certificate & serve HTTPS traffic.\nOnly HTTPS traffic is supported.\n\n2. Redirect non-HTTPS traffic to HTTPS.\nIt's more performant for this to be configured at the proxy level.\n\n3. Proxy to your ghost.io subdomain, leaving it set as the HOST header.\nRequired to get through our security layer.\n\n4. Have an X-Forwarded-Host header that matches the custom domain in\nmy.ghost.org.\nWithout this, your blog will redirect to your ghost.io subdomain, causing a\nloop.\n\n5. Include the X-Forwarded-Proto header set to https not http.\nWithout this your blog will redirect to https, causing a loop.\n\n6. Include the X-Forwarded-For header, populated with the remote IP of the\noriginal request.\nWithout this, we aren't able to detect spam traffic patterns and your site risks\nbeing rate limited or incorrectly restricted.\n\n7. Pass through all requests with the correct methods and headers\nYour proxy must forward all HEAD, GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests to your\nhost with the request method, headers, and response intact, and must also pass\nthrough all standard HTTP headers and any x-ghost  headers, including\nAuthorization and set-cookie.\n\nExample configurations\nThe following configurations show how to setup a reverse proxy for a\nsubdirectory. \n\n * Nginx [https://docs.ghost.org/faq/nginx-subdirectory-setup/]\n * Apache [https://docs.ghost.org/faq/apache-subdirectory-setup/]\n * CloudFront [https://docs.ghost.org/faq/cloudfront-subdirectory-setup/]\n\nTroubleshooting\nThese configurations are only guaranteed  to work in isolation. If you have any\npre-existing top-level domain config, this could override the subdirectory. To\ntroubleshoot any issues, review your top-level domain config for conflicts.\n\nVerification\nTo ensure your proxy is sending the correct headers use the following curl\ncommand:\n\n  curl -IL -H 'x-ghost-proxy:true' https://<your domain here>/<subdirectory>  \n\nIf your proxy is correct you’ll see a response header of x-ghost-proxy set to\nVALID. If an invalid header is detected, you will see INVALID next to it.  This\ncommand only verifies headers and does not check that all traffic is being\nrouted correctly.\n\nOnce your proxy is configured, we recommend verifying the following things, to\nensure the proxy is working fully:\n\n * Login to https://<your domain here>/<subdirectory>/ghost/\n * Upload an image\n * Create and schedule a post \n * Delete a post\n * See changes reflected in the sitemap at https://<your domain\n   here>/<subdirectory>/sitemap.xml","featured":false,"created_at_pretty":"27 September, 2018","published_at_pretty":"27 September, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"28 March, 2019","created_at":"2018-09-27T23:05:28.000+00:00","published_at":"2018-09-27T23:07:00.000+00:00","updated_at":"2019-03-28T10:12:42.000+00:00","tags":[{"name":"Ghost(Pro)","slug":"ghost-pro","visibility":"public"},{"name":"#faq","slug":"hash-faq","visibility":"internal"}],"authors":[{"name":"Sarah Frantz","slug":"sarah"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5bad05c8f193d500bfd5b3f4","slug":"change-ghost-io-subdomain","title":"How do I change my ghost.io subdomain?","excerpt":"Learn how to change your ghost.io subdomain using Ghost admin.
