If you are using Ghost(Pro)\n[https://ghost.org/pricing/]  and require a manual upgrade, contact support!\nWhy upgrade to 1.0?\nIf you‚Äôre still running an older version of Ghost, we highly recommended that\nyou upgrade to ensure you have all of the latest features, security and support.\nGhost 0.x is no longer supported, which means it is not secure and more\ndifficult to maintain. Here‚Äôs the current version history and end of life\nsupport [https://docs.ghost.org/faq/major-versions-lts/].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPrerequisites\nTo upgrade to Ghost 1.0 you must be running an LTS version of Ghost (0.x). This\nupgrade requires creating a brand new install and importing your JSON content\nexport, so it is a prerequisite to ensure you have a full backup in place before\nyou begin. Here's a breakdown of the steps that you‚Äôll go through:\n\n * Prepare your theme\n * Backup your content\n * Create a new Ghost v1.0.0 install\n * Import your JSON file\n * Copy your images to your new site\n * Upload your theme\n * Update external sites using Public API\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPrepare your theme\nSince there are breaking changes in the theme API between Ghost LTS and 1.0,\nyour theme may need to be updated. \n\nCheck theme compatibility using gscan\nUsing the tool gscan [https://gscan.ghost.org]  is the fastest way to check your\ntheme compatibility against all current versions of Ghost. It allows you to\nupload a zip file of your current theme to check for errors, deprecations and\nother compatibility issues.\n\n 1. Download your current active theme as a .zip from the design settings page\n    in Ghost admin.\n 2. Upload this file on the gscan page [https://gscan.ghost.org]\n 3. Select 1.0.0 as the Ghost version to check your theme for this upgrade -\n    it's also recommended you do this for the latest version of Ghost so that\n    you are able to upgrade to that once this upgrade has been completed\n\nThe tool lists all errors and provide a full explanation and description of how\nto update your theme. All items listed as ‚Äúmust fix‚Äù are required to be updated\nwithin your theme for the 1.0.0 upgrade. Any items listed as ‚Äúconsider fixing‚Äù\nare recommended to ensure future upgrades are smoother. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBackup your content\nWhen backing up a Ghost site, there are 2 main things that need to be done:\n\n 1. Download a JSON export from Ghost admin\n 2. Ensure you have a backup of your content folder\n\nJSON export\nRetrieve an up-to-date JSON export from the Ghost admin in the labs section,\nwhich can be accessed at yourdomain.com/ghost/settings/labs/. This downloads a\nJSON export file that you‚Äôll need later to your machine. \n\nContent folder backup\nAll user-provided data such as images and themes exist in the /content/ folder.\nWe strongly recommend making a copy of these files. To do this run the following\ncommand on yours sever: \n\ncp -r content /tmp/content-backup\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCreate a new Ghost 1.0.0 install\nSince there is no automatic upgrade path for this version of Ghost, you'll need\nto create a clean install of Ghost 1.0.0 to production. \n\nFollow the step-by-step guide to install Ghost on your server\n[https://docs.ghost.org/install/ubuntu/]  using the Ghost CLI. When you install\nGhost, use the installation command with the version number to install the\ncorrect version of Ghost for this upgrade:\n\nghost install --v1\n\n\nUpon install, follow the setup questions as directed in the guide and ensure\nyour new install is configured correctly.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nImport your JSON file\nOnce Ghost has been reinstalled on your server, you can import your content\nusing the JSON file that you exported earlier. Import your file in the labs\nscreen under settings in Ghost admin.\n\nAll user accounts are locked on import\nThe Ghost importer does not import user passwords or tokens. All user accounts\n(except the one used to do the import) are locked on import. Use the password\nreset mechanism to regain access.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCopy your images\nYour content folder backup that you created earlier now needs to be moved from\nyour existing directory <old-ghost-dir>/content/images  to the new blog\ndirectory <new-ghost-dir>/content/images.\n\nThis content directory functions the same, and exists in the same place as in\nprevious Ghost versions. After copying your files into the new /content/ \nfolder, make sure they belong to the correct Ghost user by running: \n\nsudo chown -R ghost:ghost content\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpload your theme\nOnce your theme is fully prepared for Ghost 1.0.0 following the guidelines given\non gscan.ghost.org [https://gscan.ghost.org/], upload the final .zip  file into\nyour new Ghost install. Themes are uploaded in the design settings page inside\nof your Ghost admin. \n\nTo upload a theme manually, copy the theme into <new-ghost-dir>/content/themes.\nEnsure the folder is owned by the ghost user and run ghost restart to make Ghost\nsee it.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate external sites using Content API\nIf you have external sites which are using the Content API to pull data from\nGhost, you'll need to make some updates to ensure this stays working. Consult\nthe API documentation [https://docs.ghost.org/api/content/]  for further\ninformation. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSummary\nNow that you have successfully upgraded from Ghost LTS to Ghost 1.0, you can use\n ghost-cli  to upgrade to the latest version of Ghost with all of the latest\nfeatures üéâ\n\nThe 2.0.0 upgrade [https://docs.ghost.org/faq/upgrade-to-ghost-2-0/]  is\nconsiderably less manual than this one, and it's highly recommended you do this\nnow.","html":"<p>Ghost 1.0 was released in July 2017 marking the 100th release of Ghost, and the first major upgrade since the platform launched.</p><p>This is a major upgrade, with breaking changes and no automatic migration path. <strong>All publications upgrading from Ghost LTS versions (0.x) must be upgraded to Ghost 1.0 before they can be successfully upgraded to Ghost 2.0 and beyond.</strong> </p><blockquote>This guide is useful for self-hosted Ghost users.
