You can think of it loosely like JSON without all the brackets and commas. In short, it's a document format used to store nested <code class=\"language-text\">key:value</code> pairs, commonly used for simple/readable configuration.</p>\n<p>The most important thing to know when working with YAML is that it uses indentation to denote structure. That means the <strong>only</strong> type of nesting which works is <strong>2 spaces</strong>.</p>\n<p>The most common reason for YAML files not working is when you accidentally use the wrong type or quantity of spacing for indentation. So keep a close eye on that!</p>\n<h2 id=\"when-to-use-dynamic-routing\"><a href=\"#when-to-use-dynamic-routing\" aria-label=\"when to use dynamic routing permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>When to use dynamic routing</h2>\n<p>Maybe you want your homepage to be a simple landing page, while all of your posts appear on <code class=\"language-text\">site.com/writing/</code>. Maybe you actually want to split your site into two main collections of content, like <code class=\"language-text\">/blog/</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">/podcast/</code>. Maybe you just want to change the URL of your archives from <code class=\"language-text\">/tag/news/</code> to <code class=\"language-text\">/archive/news/</code>.</p>\n<p>If you're looking to create an alternative site structure to the one described above, then dynamic routing is what you need in order to achieve all your hopes and dreams.</p>\n<p>Okay maybe not all your hopes and dreams but at least your URLs.
